# About
The proposed defense is designed to protect mobile users from cellular traffic fingerprinting attacks, where an adversary infers application usage or in-app activities by analyzing encrypted LTE/5G traffic metadata.

Our approach introduces a traffic-shaping layer at the PDCP level, applicable to both the UE and the base station. By transmitting fixed-size packets at fixed intervals, supplemented with padding or dummy packets when necessary, the defense hides distinctive traffic patterns such as burstiness, packet size variations, and timing correlations. This mechanism makes traffic generated by different applications statistically indistinguishable, significantly reducing the attacker’s ability to classify apps or activities.
